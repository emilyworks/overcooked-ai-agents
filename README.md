# overcooked-ai

This repository aims to support experiemnts on AI-AI cooperation and is adapted from In-Chang's [overcooked-ai](https://github.com/bic4907/Overcooked-AI). It builds on the work in overcooked-ai by adding AI agent pairs that follow different gameplay policies. 

**Getting Started**

1. The code for various AI agents can be found in test/agents.py . 

2. Start ipython and run test/environment_state_action.py to run visualizations of agents working in their Overcooked environment.
