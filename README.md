# overcooked-ai

This repository aims to support experiments on AI-AI cooperation and is adapted from In-Chang's [overcooked-ai](https://github.com/bic4907/Overcooked-AI). It builds on the work in overcooked-ai by adding AI agent pairs that follow different gameplay policies. 

**Getting Started**

1. Install dependencies by typing "pip3 install -r requirements2.txt" (make sure you are in the root folder when you do this, otherwise the path may need to be modified)
 
2. The code for various AI agents can be found in test/agents.py . 

3. Start ipython and run test/environment_state_action.py to run visualizations of agents working in their Overcooked environment.

For specifics on existing agent code and how to run the code, please refer to in-file comments.
